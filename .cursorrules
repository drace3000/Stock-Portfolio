# Cursor Rules for Stock Portfolio Project

## Git Workflow Rules

### Commit and Push Rules
- Always commit changes with descriptive commit messages
- Commit messages should follow format: "Brief description of changes"
- After making significant changes, automatically stage, commit, and push to GitHub
- Use the GitHub token stored in environment or provided by user for authentication
- Remote repository: https://github.com/drace3000/Stock-Portfolio.git
- Default branch: master

### Deployment Workflow
1. After completing a feature or set of changes:
   - Stage all changes: `git add .`
   - Commit with descriptive message
   - Push to remote: `git push origin master`
   - Remove token from remote URL after push for security

### Code Quality Rules
- All code files must have file-level comments describing purpose
- Complex logic should have inline comments explaining how it works
- Follow existing code style and patterns
- Ensure no linter errors before committing

### Security Rules
- Never commit API keys or sensitive data
- Always remove tokens from git remote URL after use
- Ensure .env.local is in .gitignore
- Never hardcode credentials in code

### File Organization
- Components in `/components` directory
- API clients in `/lib/api` directory
- State management in `/lib/store` directory
- Utilities in `/lib/utils.ts`
- Styles in `/app/globals.css`
- Config files in root directory

### Testing Before Push
- Check for linter errors
- Verify all imports are correct
- Ensure TypeScript compiles without errors
- Test that the app runs without runtime errors
